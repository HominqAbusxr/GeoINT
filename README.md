# GeoInt

An agent skill for finding where any photo, screenshot, video, recording or Street View image was taken — the
instincts of a strong GeoGuessr player plus the discipline of an OSINT investigation. The agent leads with its own
expert read of the scene (a written gut call), then proves, sharpens or overturns it with web research and local
tools, down to street or camera level when the evidence allows. Every photo gets its own timestamped archive with
a report, evidence images and a scoreboard once the true location is known.

`SKILL.md` is the method; `references/` holds the playbooks and the worldwide clue library; `scripts/` holds the
tools.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marouane53/GeoInt.git ~/.agents/skills/geoint   # Codex and other agents
ln -s ~/.agents/skills/geoint ~/.claude/skills/geoint                         # Claude Code
uv run ~/.agents/skills/geoint/scripts/doctor.py --network                        # check the setup
uv run ~/.agents/skills/geoint/scripts/doctor.py --models                         # optional: pre-download local models (~6.2 GB)
```

Requirements: Python 3.10+, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), `curl`; `exiftool` and `ffmpeg` recommended. Each
script declares its own dependencies and runs with `uv run`. Per-photo archives go to `~/geoint-photos` with
timestamps in this computer's time zone; set `GEOINT_PHOTOS` / `GEOINT_TZ`, or put
`{"photos_root": "…", "timezone": "…"}` in a `config.local.json` next to `SKILL.md` (git-ignored), to change that.
The optional Gemini check of reverse-search results (`compare.py`) reads `GEMINI_API_KEY`, or the env file named by
`"gemini_env_file"` in the same `config.local.json`; without a key, results are ranked locally only.

## What's inside

| Area | Tools |
|---|---|
| Archive and scoring | `photo_session.py` (start / finish / truth / scoreboard / list), `bench.py` |
| One-command local first pass | `recon.py` → `meta.py`, `intake.py`, `ocr.py`, `textgeo.py`, `detect.py`, `calib.py`, `prior.py`, `compare.py` |
| Reverse-search results → leads | `compare.py` (every similar image from every list and crop, merged, ranked against the photo with MegaLoc, the top ones checked by Gemini one image at a time; also ranks a venue's photos), `triage.py` (a lead's page: every picture and caption, ranked, with OCR), `imgprep.py mask` (people painted out before a search) |
| Text → place | `textgeo.py` (scripts, telltale letters, language, phone numbers incl. unreadable digits, domains, postal codes, currency, regional words, ~50k brands, GeoNames places), `geodata.py`, `clues.py` (incl. 2,100 regional plate codes across ten countries, with the years each was in use) |
| Reasoning ledger | `board.py` — candidates, clues, likelihood ratios capped by evidence type, exclusion rules, rank / next / check / report |
| Street level | `pano.py` (every provider plus your own manifests: coverage, list, render, sheet), `sweep.py` (rank every panorama of whole towns with MegaLoc), `gsv.py`, `refsheet.py` (real Street View rows per candidate country, region or town), `match.py`, `baidu_pano.py` |
| Clue → short list | `opendata.py` (city open-data portals: bus lanes, street trees, hydrants… filtered to candidate points), `osm.py addr` (house numbers, alone or co-occurring) |
| Skyline → place | `terrain.py find`: every place of an area ranked by how much of the photo's skyline shape the terrain there explains, each part of the trace judged on its own, decoys of the trace (mirrored, upside down) searched as a control, and a trust level (solid / check / weak) with its reasons, overlays and a map of the scores; `check` for one place, `ridge` to trace the skyline (snow under a blue sky included), `view --peaks` to name the summits in view; terrain from Mapterhorn (Copernicus GLO-30 plus national lidar) |
| Maps and geometry | `osm.py`, `poi.py`, `gazetteer.py`, `tiles.py` (incl. NASA daily satellite passes), `sat_scan.py`, `terrain.py`, `sun.py` (incl. past weather by day), `geo.py`, `pose.py`, `evidence.py` (incl. colour-coded match sheets) |
| Sound → place and time | `audio.py`: inaudible aircraft passes made visible, each fitted for speed and closest-approach distance, then searched against that day's open ADS-B tracks and scored on the modelled Doppler curves (often 100–300 m from two passes, plus the recording's start time); thunder against lightning records (GOES GLM built in); mains hum (50/60 Hz, ENF) |
| Local models | StreetCLIP + GeoCLIP world prior (`prior.py`), OWLv2 object crops (`detect.py`), GeoCalib camera calibration (`calib.py`), MegaLoc place recognition (`sweep.py`, `match.py`, `compare.py`, `triage.py`), DINOv2/CLIP matching; optionally Gemini Flash to check search results |

The skill works end to end without asking questions: reverse image search, web search, maps and Street View
lookups run automatically as part of the flow.

## Tests

```bash
uv run tests/test_tools.py && uv run tests/test_runtime.py && uv run tests/test_audio.py && uv run tests/test_skyline.py && python3 -m unittest tests/test_photo_session.py

### Methods GeoInt learned from

GeoInt's code for these is its own; the methods and findings are theirs.

- **[Azimut](https://github.com/OsintMeThat/azimut)** by OsintMeThat, an open-source OSINT workspace whose Find mode
  ranks the places of an area whose relief fits a photo's traced skyline. GeoInt's skyline search (`terrain.py find`
  and `check`, `references/skyline.md`) follows its method: a place scored by how much of the trace's shape it
  explains, part by part across the frame; decoy traces as a control; trust read against what the area fits by
  chance; the skyline cut at several distances for haze; Mapterhorn terrain. Azimut is AGPL-3.0, and none of its
  code is copied here.
- **[colsto](https://www.youtube.com/@colsto)**, whose video
  [I discovered a sound that leaks your exact location](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UytYrhYLOKI) showed how
  aircraft passes too faint to hear, matched against open ADS-B tracks, give a microphone's position. He did not
  release his code; `audio.py` and `references/audio.md` are GeoInt's own implementation of the idea.
- **[Rainbolt](https://www.youtube.com/@georainbolt)**, whose way of turning one small detail into a short list of
  places (a house number, a half-read phone number, a licence plate, the weather that day) shaped `opendata.py`,
  `osm.py addr`, `textgeo.py --phone-pattern`, the plate codes in `clues.py` and `sun.py weather`.
